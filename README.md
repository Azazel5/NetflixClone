# Netflix-Clone

![DemoGif](flixdemo.gif)

A Netflix clone I created for the sake of practicing React and Redux. It features design 
patterns recommended by the documentation. Some of the tools used include: <br />

* Hooks (and custom hooks)
* React Router
* Redux Toolkit 
* Context API 
* Responsive web design 
* Cypress end-to-end testing 

<br />

It is a work in progress, and my first real project with React. Any tips on how to better write the 
code, manage the folder structure, etc would be really appreciated. <br />

The future of this project: <br />

* Integrate it with a Django backend
* Create an authentication flow
* Add REST API endpoints for every user-related event, such as adding Netflix profiles
